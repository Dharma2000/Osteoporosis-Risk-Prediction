# Osteoporosis-Risk-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict the risk of osteoporosis in patients using a dataset of patients' medical records. Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture.
